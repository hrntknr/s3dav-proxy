# s3dav-proxy

## Abount s3dav-proxy
s3dav-proxy is software that allows s3 compatible file servers to be operated via the webdav protocol.  
It uses webdav authentication information as it is as an s3 access key/secret, so it is unique in that it can reuse s3 access privileges, etc.  
It is intended to be self-hosted with minio, but will also work with s3.
